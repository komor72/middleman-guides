Middleman Guides
================

These are the source files that power the [Middleman guides site](https://middlemanapp.com/),
which is itself a [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman)-powered static page.

The guides are the primary documentation for Middleman, explaining the core features and extensions as well as pointing out community extensions.

Middleman is ever-vigilant against tag-soup, unreadable CSS and repetition. It stands-watch
over your Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript producing only the cleanest and most efficient
markup.

## How to run the site locally

Make sure you have Ruby 1.9.3+ and Bundler installed, then clone this repo and run `bundle install`.
Then run `bundle exec middleman server` to start the server at `http://localhost:4567`

## Mailing List

If you have questions, answers can be found on our [community  forum](http://forum.middlemanapp.com/).

## Contributing

Please help Middleman flesh out its documentation. We'll merge in any reasonable
extensions to our website docs, and give credit for your help!

The guides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
